# A Signup / Login Feature

**Created in Godot Version 3.5**

Super simple application that shows how to handle common Login and account creation using Godot engine.

All accounts created are saved in %appdata%/SignupApp/Accounts.json , Instead of reading and writing to disk you could instead connect it to a server to read data from there instead.

All password created are Hashed before stored as an extra layer of protection.
